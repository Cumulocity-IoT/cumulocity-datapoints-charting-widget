-   Initial Release.

## Known Issues

-   If the legend is on the right side, resizing to the smallest box causes the chart/axis to “invert” and then disappear. If you have the legend in any other position it seems to resize okay.
-   Legend Position -> "Chart Area" and "fill area under chart" will be hiding the text. Might need to consider a solid background colour for the legend.
